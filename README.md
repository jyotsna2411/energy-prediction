# Energy Imbalance Reduction Challenge: Predictive Modeling for Prosumer Energy Behavior

## Project Description:
This project aims to reduce energy imbalances by predicting prosumer energy behavior through predictive modeling. The project involves importing requirements, exploring individual datasets, aggregating data, feature engineering, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Data Aggregation:
- Imported and processed data from various datasets including client information, electricity prices, forecast weather, gas prices, historical weather, train data, and weather station mapping.
- Aggregated data based on date and local levels.
- Engineered features and transformed data for machine learning tasks.

## Machine Learning Techniques:
The project utilizes the following machine learning techniques and algorithms: 
- Ensemble Learning: Using VotingRegressor to combine multiple models for energy consumption predictions.
- Transformed Target Regression: Leveraging TransformedTargetRegressor for improved prediction accuracy by transforming the target variable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis - Aggregated DataFrame:
- The final DataFrame consists of 2,018,352 rows and 135 columns.
- It includes features such as county, is_business, product_type, target, is_consumption, and various other engineered features.
- The DataFrame contains less than 0.1% null values in most columns.

## Repository Contents:
- final_df.csv: CSV file containing the final aggregated DataFrame.
- Jupyter Notebook files with Python code for data processing, feature engineering, and EDA.
- Readme file with project information.

## Installation Requirements:
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, polars, optuna.

## Data Sources:
- Kaggle dataset on energy consumption.

## Future Scope:
- Implement and optimize machine learning models using advanced algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters for energy consumption predictions.
- Deploy models for real-time energy imbalance reduction challenges.
